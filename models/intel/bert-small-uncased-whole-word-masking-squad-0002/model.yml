description: >-
  This is a small BERT-large like model distilled on SQuAD v1.1 training set from
  original bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad provided by the Transformers
  <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers> library. The model performs question
  answering for English language; the input is a concatenated premise and question
  for the premise, and the output is the location of the answer to the question inside
  the premise. For details about the original model, check out BERT: Pre-training
  of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805>,
  HuggingFace's Transformers: State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03771>.

  Tokenization occurs using the BERT tokenizer (see the demo code for implementation
  details) and the enclosed "vocab.txt" dictionary file. Input is to be lower-cased
  before tokenizing.
